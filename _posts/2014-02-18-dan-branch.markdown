[Dan Branch](http://www.danrbranch.co.uk/vote/), a certified Excellent Person, is running to be student union president for Southampton University. You should read about his [sensible platform](https://www.susu.org/running-your-union/elections/2013/spring/manifesto/daniel-branch) and form voting-type opinions accordingly. And remember that this is the man who once claimed to me that Thursdays can run out.
